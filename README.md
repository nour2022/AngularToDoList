# ToDoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.6.
Developed a dynamic To-Do List application utilizing Angular 18, showcasing modern front-end development practices. The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks effortlessly. Instead of traditional APIs, the application leverages a JSON for data storage and retrieval, ensuring fast access and efficient data handling.

Key features include:

Task management functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

Clear separation of completed and pending tasks, enhancing usability.

Real-time updates to the task list with immediate visual feedback on user actions.

Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
